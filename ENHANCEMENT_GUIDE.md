### Smart Contract Integration
- **Current**: Single staking contract with 7-day lockup
- **Enhanced**: Pool-based staking (ready for multiple contracts)
- **Security**: ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20, minimum staking periods

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- MetaMask browser extension
- Git

### 1. Setup and Installation
```bash
# Already cloned and installed, but if starting fresh:
cd defi-staking-platform
npm install
```

### 2. Start Local Development

**Terminal 1 - Start Hardhat Node:**
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
Keep this running. You'll see test accounts with private keys.

**Terminal 2 - Deploy Contracts:**
```bash
npm run deploy:local
```
This creates a `deployments.json` file with contract addresses.

**Terminal 3 - Start Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Configure MetaMask
1. **Add Local Network:**
   - Network Name: `Localhost 8545`
   - RPC URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
   - Chain ID: `1337`
   - Currency Symbol: `ETH`

2. **Import Test Account:**
   - Copy a private key from the Hardhat node output
   - Import it into MetaMask

### 4. Test the Platform
1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect MetaMask"
2. **Get Test Tokens**: Already minted via deployment script
3. **Explore Features**:
   - **Stake Tab**: Original staking functionality
   - **Pools Tab**: Choose from different staking pools
   - **Analytics Tab**: View performance metrics and charts

## 📈 Feature Walkthrough

### Staking Interface

## 🛠️ Development Notes

### Styling System

- **Liquidity Pools**: DEX integration framework in place
- **Advanced Security**: Emergency pause and timelock features

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Adding New Pools
Edit `src/components/StakingPools.jsx` to add new pool configurations:
```javascript
{
  id: 'custom-pool',
  name: 'Custom Pool',
  description: 'Your pool description',
  apy: 45.0,
  lockPeriod: 60,
  minStake: 2.0,
  maxStake: 75000,
  // ... other properties
}
```

### Styling Customization
Use CSS variables in `enhanced.css`:
```css
:root {
  --primary-gradient: your-gradient;
  --success-color: your-color;
  --card-glass: your-transparency;
}
```

### Analytics Configuration
Modify time ranges and metrics in `AnalyticsDashboard.jsx`:
```javascript
const timeRange = ['7d', '30d', '90d', '1y'] // Add new ranges
const metrics = ['apy', 'volume', 'users'] // Track new metrics
```

## 🚦 Testing Scenarios

### Basic Flow
1. Connect wallet → View stats → Stake tokens → Wait → Claim rewards
2. Try different pools → Compare APY → Monitor analytics
3. Test responsive design → Mobile compatibility

### Edge Cases
- Stake minimum amounts
- Test with insufficient balance
- Try withdrawing before lock period
- Network switching behavior
