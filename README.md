```

### 2. Firebase Configuration

**Create Firebase Project:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project named `defi-staking-platform`
3. Enable Authentication ‚Üí Email/Password provider
4. Create Firestore Database (start in test mode)
5. Copy your Firebase config

**Setup Environment:**
```bash
# Copy example env file
cp .env.example .env

# Add your Firebase config to .env:
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

### 3. Start Local Blockchain
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Hardhat node
npm run node
```

### 4. Deploy Contracts
```bash
# Terminal 2 - Deploy contracts
npm run deploy:local
```

### 5. Start Frontend
```bash
# Terminal 3 - Start React app

   - RPC URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
   - Chain ID: `1337`
   - Currency Symbol: `ETH`

2. Import a test account using one of the private keys from Hardhat node output

### 7. Get Test Tokens
The deployment script automatically:
- Mints 1M STK tokens to deployer
- Mints 10M RWD tokens for rewards  
- Transfers 5M RWD to staking contract
- Mints additional 100k STK for testing

## üìñ How to Use

### For Users

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - Click "Connect MetaMask" 
   - Approve the connection

2. **Stake Tokens**
   - Enter amount of STK to stake
   - Approve token spending (first time)
   - Confirm staking transaction
   - Tokens are locked for 7 days minimum

3. **Monitor Rewards**
   - View real-time reward accumulation
   - Rewards accrue at 100 RWD per second per staked STK
   - Stats update every 10 seconds

4. **Claim Rewards**
   - Click "Claim Rewards" to collect RWD tokens
   - Rewards can be claimed anytime without unstaking

5. **Withdraw Tokens**
   - Wait 7 days after staking
   - Enter amount to withdraw (up to staked balance)
   - Confirm withdrawal transaction

6. **Exit (Advanced)**
   - Withdraws all staked tokens AND claims all rewards
   - Only available after 7-day minimum period

### For Developers

#### Contract Addresses
After deployment, contract addresses are saved to `deployments.json`:
```json
{
  "network": "localhost", 
  "deployer": "0x...",
  "contracts": {
    "StakingToken": "0x...",
    "RewardToken": "0x...", 
    "TokenStaking": "0x..."
  }
}
```
